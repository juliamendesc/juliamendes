# Welcome to my page code!

Made with ðŸ’œ by me ðŸ¤—

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I decided to experiment with [Less](https://lesscss.org/) as a preprocessor. Thanks to [Joseph Chow's explanation](https://www.josephc.how/using-less-with-react/), I have managed to make the necessary adjustments for this to run in such a small project.

Therefore, the page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
