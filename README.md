## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I decided to experiment with [Less](https://lesscss.org/) as a preprocessor. Thanks to [Joseph Chow's explanation](https://www.josephc.how/using-less-with-react/), I have managed to make the necessary adjustments for this to run in such a small project.

Therefore, the page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
